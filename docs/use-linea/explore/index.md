[HAPI](https://hapi-one.gitbook.io/hapi-protocol) is an on-chain cybersecurity protocol that aims to prevent hackers and exploiters from committing fraud across various blockchains. 
By incorporating an on-chain database approach and distributed KYT/AML solution, [HAPI](https://hapi.one/) provides a wide variety of tools and methods to safeguard clients from common cybersecurity-related threats.


This step-by-step guide teaches how to track the transactions via [HAPILabs](https://linea.hapilabs.one/) terminal and participate in Linea vs HAPI ”Send and Investigate” quest.


**Chapter 0. Preparation.**

**Step 1.** **Download [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download/)**

**Chapter 1. HAPI Campaign.**


**Step 1**. **Accounts creation.**

Go to your MetaMask and create 2 fresh Linea testnet accounts. You can name them, for example **Linea 2**, **Linea 3**. You should now have **3 accounts** in your MetaMask: 
Your main account (the one you used for the Linea Voyage Quest in Galxe) - we can call this **Linea 1**,
**Linea 2** (newly created),
**Linea 3** (newly created).

Send **0,0002 LineaETH** from **Linea 1** to **Linea 2**

Send **0,0003 LineaETH** from **Linea 1** to **Linea 3**


**Step 3.** **Investigation.** 

Connect your MetaMask **Linea 1** wallet to the [HAPILabs](https://linea.hapilabs.one/) terminal. 

Paste your **Linea 1** wallet address to HAPILabs terminal address bar (1), choose the correct period (2), and push the “find” button (3) as follows:
